\section{Spacecraft Operations}
\begin{itemize}
 \item remotely control of a spacecraft
 \item after the separation from the launcher the satellite can only be controlled remotely
 \item the operations phase shows ultimately if all considerations in the development phase were right and the mission is successful
 \item especially at the early operations phase and in critical situations the public interest is large and the fascination of space missions is noticeable
 \item at this moment, mission operations is in focus and it is decided whether the mission is successful or not
 \item mission objectives determine all aspects of a space mission, including the operations. All mission and system requirements are derived either from these objectives or mission
 constraints.
\end{itemize}
\f{Basic Functions of Spacecraft Operations}
\begin{itemize}
 \item mission planning
 \begin{itemize}
  \item priorization of user requests
  \item development of timelines for operations
  \item development of timelines for ground stations
  \item creation of command files
  \item support of special requests
  \item computation of orbital elements
  \item operation and use of ground data networks
  \item optimization of utilization
 \end{itemize}

 \item training of personnel
 \begin{itemize}
  \item development of a training program
  \item training on a simulator
  \item training on spacecraft
  \item continuous training (in flight)
 \end{itemize}

 \item mission operations
 \begin{itemize}
  \item commanding of spacecraft
  \item monitoring of subsystems (online)
  \item payload management
  \item trend analysis (offline)
  \item anomaly handling
 \end{itemize}

 \item scientific and technical support 
 \begin{itemize}
  \item support in both directions (operations $\leftrightarrow$ development)
  \item early start of contributions (already at study level in Phase A)
  \item construction and test
  \item planning of orbital maneuvers
  \item management of payload and subsystems
  \item anomaly management
  \item flight software management
  \item management of simulators
  \item database management
  \item trend analysis for the spacecraft
 \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
